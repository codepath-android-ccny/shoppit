## Overview

### Description

_ShoppIt_ is an Android app that allows people to buy groceries online. To build the app, we used Android studio and Java. In this app, users can sign up, login, and logout from their account. They can revisit the same page after their app restarts. They are allowed to browse through the items and see the product info such as: category names, cost, availability, and expiration date. They can create separate categories to add, edit, and delete different items. People can order the products to their home and they are allowed to choose different shipping options during the checkout.
